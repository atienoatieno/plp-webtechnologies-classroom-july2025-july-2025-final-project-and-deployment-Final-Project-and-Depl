## Deployment
1. Files uploaded to GitHub.  
2. GitHub Pages enabled from Settings → Pages → Source = main branch, root folder.  
3. `.nojekyll` file added to stop Jekyll from blocking assets.  
4. Site is live at:  
https://atienoatieno.github.io/SafariSpark-Digital-/

## Testing
- Website works on different screen sizes.  
- Form shows errors for invalid input and success message when valid.  
- Slider changes images automatically and with buttons.  
- Navigation works on both desktop and mobile.  

---

## Challenges
- At first, the site showed only text (“skeleton”) because the files were not in the right folders.  
- Fixed by moving CSS, JS, and images into the correct `assets` folders.  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- How to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript together.  
- How to deploy a live site with GitHub Pages.  
- Importance of correct file paths and folder structure.  
- Simple debugging skills.

## Conclusion
SafariSpark Digital shows how to build and publish a working website using basic web technologies. It is clean, simple, and demonstrates skills in design, coding, and deployment.
